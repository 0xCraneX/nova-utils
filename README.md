# Fearless Utils

## About 
This repo contains static information (logos, links, etc) to support client apps in Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem (e.g. [Fearless Wallet]) to map it to the keys/ids from the network itself.

Note: For better UX in your app its recommended to 
1. prepare UI states & logic when this information cannot be fetched due to github unavailability
2. cache the data to cover part of the issue of 1.

## Modules
#### Crowdloan
Crowdloans can be saturated with the following information:
* id (to map the static data)
* Parachain name
* Description

* Token
* Website
